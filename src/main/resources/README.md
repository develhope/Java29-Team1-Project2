# 🌱 Green Ripple: Your Energy, Your City's Future

---

## 🌿 Concept

**Green Ripple** is an innovative app that transforms energy generated by renewable systems — such as subway turnstiles, piezoelectric sidewalks, solar panels, energy-generating bicycles, playgrounds, and kinetic revolving doors — into real sustainable actions that improve urban life.

---

## 🎯 Final Goal

As developers, our goal is not to propose new physical technologies, but to build an app that **leverages existing energy systems** to:

- Engage users
- Monitor energy generation
- Convert it into meaningful individual and collective benefits

🟢 **Every daily action can contribute to a greener future.**

## 🌱 Dual Perspective: Personal and Collective Impact

### 👤 For the Individual

Each user has a personal profile where they can track:

- Their eco-friendly activities
- Accumulated Green Points
- Energy produced and CO₂ saved

#### Activities that **reduce CO₂ emissions**:
- 🚇 Using public transportation (metro, bus, etc.)
- 🚲 Using electric or sustainable transport (e-bikes, scooters)
- 🚶 Walking (step counting)

#### Activities that **generate energy**:
- 🚇 Passing through metro turnstiles
- 🌿 Walking on piezoelectric sidewalks
- ⚡ Riding energy-generating bikes
- 🏋️ Using gym equipment that produces energy
- ♻️ Recycling using QR codes on smart bins
- 🎡 Playing in energy-generating playgrounds
- 🔄 Walking through kinetic revolving doors

🎁 **Green Points** can be used to:
- Buy eco-friendly products 🛒
- Get subscriptions for green transport 🚲
- Access discounts from sustainable partner companies 🌍

---

### 🏙️ For the Community

The total energy collected can be directed to **eco-friendly urban projects**.  
Users can vote on how to allocate this energy by choosing among causes like:

- 🌳 Planting a tree in your neighborhood
- 💧 Watering a public garden
- 💡 Powering sustainable lighting in a square

A **public progress bar** shows how close each project is to its energy goal.  
Once it reaches 100%, implementation begins.

## 🔋 Monitoring Energy & CO₂ Savings

The app tracks both energy generated and CO₂ avoided.  
For example:
> "You generated 0.08 Wh and saved 85 g of CO₂ 🌿"  
> "This week you avoided 500 g of CO₂: equal to a LED bulb on for 10 hours!"

---

## 🏆 Gamification & Engagement

- 🎖️ **Personal challenges**:  
  _"If you save 1 kg of CO₂ this month, you earn the EcoTraveler badge."_

- 🌍 **Community challenges**:  
  _"If your city saves 500 kg of CO₂, a tree will be planted in your district."_

- 📊 **Public dashboard** shows:
    - Your profile: Green Points & CO₂ saved
    - Your area’s progress: energy & milestones
    - Total urban impact: tons of CO₂ avoided

---

## 📲 Slogan

> **"Every step, every ride, every move: a benefit for you, a gift for the planet.  
> Move, save, breathe."**

Green Ripple is more than just an app.  
**It’s a digital movement to build a greener future.** 🌍
